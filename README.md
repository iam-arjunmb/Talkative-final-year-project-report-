### Project Description:  
**Title**: **Talkative: A Sign Language to Speech Translator for Mute and Deaf**

The project "Talkative" aims to bridge the communication gap for individuals with hearing and speech impairments by translating sign language gestures into audible speech. It is an innovative wearable device in the form of a glove embedded with advanced sensors and machine learning capabilities to enable seamless interaction with the hearing community.

#### **Overview**:  
The wearable glove is equipped with flex sensors, an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a Bluetooth module, which work together to capture and transmit hand movements and gestures. These gestures are processed by a system that uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to interpret them into corresponding words. The translated words are then converted into speech using a text-to-speech engine, enabling real-time communication.

#### **Key Components**:
1. **Hardware**:
   - **Flex Sensors**: Measure finger bends to detect specific gestures.
   - **Accelerometer & Gyroscope**: Capture the orientation and motion of the hand.
   - **Microcontroller**: Processes sensor data and prepares it for transmission.
   - **Bluetooth Module**: Ensures wireless data transfer to the system.
   - **Speaker**: Outputs the synthesized speech.

2. **Software**:
   - **Data Processing**: Raw sensor data is collected and preprocessed.
   - **Machine Learning Model**: An SVM classifier identifies gestures and maps them to specific words.
   - **Speech Synthesis**: Recognized text is converted into speech for real-time output.

#### **Working Process**:
1. The glove senses hand gestures through its sensors, capturing both movement and orientation data.
2. This data is transmitted wirelessly to a processing system via Bluetooth.
3. The system uses an SVM model trained on a dataset of gestures to classify the input and map it to a corresponding word.
4. The classified word is then passed to a text-to-speech engine, which produces audible speech through a speaker.

#### **Impact**:  
This project provides a practical solution for individuals with speech and hearing impairments, allowing them to communicate more effectively in real-time. By leveraging advancements in sensor technology, embedded systems, and machine learning, "Talkative" offers a low-cost, portable, and scalable solution that can be further expanded to support additional languages and gestures.

#### **Future Scope**:
- Integration with mobile applications for enhanced usability.  
- Adding multi-language support for global accessibility.  
- Expanding gesture vocabulary using more advanced machine learning models like CNNs.  
- Miniaturization of the hardware for improved portability.

"Talkative" is a significant step towards creating a more inclusive society through assistive technology.
